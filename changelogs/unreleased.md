# UX

- You can now automatically create changelogs after updating mods,
  showing which versions changed.

  importing/exporting presets, etc.
- You can now choose to minimize the launcher after a game opens (new), or close it, or do nothing.
  - Configured in launcher settings (instead of per-instance settings).
- Added option to minimize launcher on game open

(still experimental, enable with `--enable-server-manager`)

  - The list now reloads in real time if your instances change on disk
