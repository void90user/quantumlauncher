# Downloads and Building

Download stable versions from [the website](https://mrmayman.github.io/quantumlauncher/#downloads), or from [Releases](http://github.com/Mrmayman/quantumlauncher/releases/latest)

Or, compile the launcher to get the latest experimental version:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mrmayman/quantumlauncher.git
cd quantum-launcher
cargo run --release
```

You can omit the `--release` flag for faster compile times, but slightly worse performance and MUCH larger build file
size.

# Why QuantumLauncher?

- QuantumLauncher provides a feature rich, flexible, simple
  and lightweight experience with plenty of modding features.

What about the others? Well...

- The official Minecraft launcher is slow, unstable, buggy and frustrating to use,
  with barely any modding features
- Legacy Launcher lacks *many* features
- TLauncher is suspected to be malware

# Notes

This launcher supports offline mode, but it's at your own risk.
I am not responsible for any issues caused.
You should buy the game, but if you can't, feel free to use this launcher
until you eventually get the means (like me).

If anyone has any issues/complaints, just open an issue in the repo.
